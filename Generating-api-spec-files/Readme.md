# Todo App Backend - OpenAPI Specification

This project is a backend service for a Todo application, developed to learn and implement OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for defining API endpoints, improving documentation, and enhancing development workflows.

## Overview

The backend service provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing todo items, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. The OpenAPI specification (`swagger.json`) serves as a single source of truth for the API contract.

## Use Cases

1. **Generating Node Clients**

   - Use the OpenAPI spec file to generate Node.js client libraries.
   - These clients abstract API calls, allowing developers to use pre-defined methods instead of explicitly using `fetch` or `axios`.
   - This approach hides the internal API implementation details from the end user.

2. **Interactive Swagger UI**

   - Access the Swagger UI at the `/docs` endpoint.
   - Use the interface to interact with APIs directly.
   - Test, debug, and validate API behavior seamlessly.

3. **Importing API Endpoints into Postman**

   - Copy the generated `swagger.json` specification file.
   - Import it directly into Postman to automatically create all API endpoints.
   - Avoid manual creation of endpoints, saving time and reducing errors.

4. **Creating GPT Plugins**
   - Use the OpenAPI spec file to create GPT plugins.
   - Enable seamless interaction between GPT models and your backend APIs.
   - Extend the usability of your backend services with AI capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Swagger (OpenAPI Specification)**
- **Postman**

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
